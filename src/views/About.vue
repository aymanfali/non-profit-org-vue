                    <li>UNESCO was created to decide what kind of society we wanted to build together after the
                        destruction
                        of two World Wars.</li>

                    <li>As early as 1942, global leaders began imagining an organization that would use education,
                        culture,
                        science and
                        information to build lasting peace.</li>

                    <li>Over the years, UNESCO has implemented initiatives that have radically improved lives around
                        the
                        world, and shaped
                        global action in its field of competence, through nation-wide educational and scientific
                        programmes, the creation of
                        tsunami warning systems, and the idea of World Heritage. Today, we are continuing this work.
