In recent years, UNESCO has been part of a broader push to strengthen Africa’s presence on World Heritage List, and highlight the continent’s rich history, diverse cultures and unique ecosystems. Since 2018, 15 new sites across 8 countries in sub-Saharan Africa have joined the World Heritage List.",

With 22 thematic sessions and 11 side-events, the Global Forum covered essential topics such as gender, environment, health, disaster risk reduction, disabilities, education, culture, neurotechnology, quantum computing, and judicial systems. With 33 representatives from Small Island Developing States (SIDS), the event amplified voices from Asia, Africa and Latin America for equitable, human-centered AI to help address national and regional challenges.

The Convention establishes shared principles to facilitate the recognition of qualifications, including partial studies and prior learning, while upholding academic integrity and quality. The Global Convention on Higher Education works closely with the five regional conventions which also strive to enhance cooperation between countries within regions. Between them, the 38 States Parties are home to some 2 million students studying outside their home countries, or 29% of the world’s estimated 6.9 million mobile students. When including the nearly 100 States Parties to all the Conventions – both global and regional – this rises to 5 million or 72% of the global total of internationally mobile students. In total, these States Parties include 131 million students, or 50% of global tertiary enrolment. ",

Beyond new inscriptions, UNESCO programmes bring greater visibility and protection to these African sites. The purpose of heritage management is not just to keep it in isolation. We need to talk about it and tell it and educate people about it, declared Fatma Twahir, site manager of Fort Jesus, Mombasa, a UNESCO World Heritage property in Kenya. These efforts are yielding real results: in July 2025, two nominations from non-represented countries will be presented to the World Heritage Committee: the Réserve de Biosphère de l’Archipel des Bijagos in Guinea-Bissau, and the Gola Tiwai Complex in Sierra Leone. Seven more are expected to submit their first nominations by 2027.",
